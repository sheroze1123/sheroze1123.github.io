## Publications and Projects

### High-Dimensional Bayesian Inference — Python, TensorFlow, NumPy, PyMC3
April 2018 – Present  
Oden Institute - The University of Texas at Austin

Enabling high-dimensional statistical inference by incorporating dimensionality reduction and physics-informed deep learning error models. Reduced-order models make Bayesian inference of simulation parameters with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods using Hamiltonian dynamics tractable, albeit with an accuracy tradeoff. Introducing physics-informed deep learning error models improves accuracy in a data-driven fashion while leveraging automatic differentiation to obtain parameter sensitivities. This work applied to neutron transport and heat conduction models was presented at the 2019 SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering in Spokane, WA and at the 2019 DTRA Annual Review in Fairfax, VA.

### Compressed Inference — Python, TensorFlow, MPI, C++, NumPy
April 2018 – Present  
Oden Institute - The University of Texas at Austin

Accelerating a parameter inference routine by compressing time-series simulation data of a large-scale distributed seismic inversion model written in C++ and parallelized using MPI using a 3D convolutional autoencoder in TensorFlow. The compression model is trained in a data-parallel manner using Horovod on TACC supercomputers Maverick2 and Lonestar5.

### Regularized Parameter Inference — Python, NumPy, SciPy, FEniCS, hIPPYlib
August 2016 – April 2018 
Oden Institute - The University of Texas at Austin
 
Implemented a limited-memory BFGS optimization routine to compute maximum a posteriori estimates given observations to reconstruct parameters in photo-acoustic tomography modeled by semi-linear diffusion equations.

## Work Experience

### Goldman Sachs, NYC — Technology Analyst

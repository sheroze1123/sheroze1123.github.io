## Publications and Projects

### High-Dimensional Bayesian Inference — Python, TensorFlow, NumPy, PyMC3
April 2018 – Present  
Oden Institute - The University of Texas at Austin

Accelerating high-dimensional parameter inference and uncertainty quantification incorporating dimensionality reduction and physics-informed neural network error models to efficiently perform Bayesian inference of simulation parameters with Markov Chain Monte Carlo using Hamiltonian dynamics. This work was presented at the 2019 SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering at Spokane, WA and the 2019 DTRA annual conference.

### Model-Aware Neural Networks for Compression — Python, TensorFlow, MPI, C++, NumPy
April 2018 – Present  
Oden Institute - The University of Texas at Austin

Accelerating parameter inference by compressing time-series data of large-scale distributed physical models using model-aware neural networks trained in a data-parallel manner using Horovod on TACC supercomputers Maverick2 and Lonestar5.

### Regularized Parameter Inference — Python, NumPy, SciPy, FEniCS, hIPPYlib
August 2016 – April 2018 
Oden Institute - The University of Texas at Austin
 
Implemented a limited-memory higher order optimization routine to infer  parameters in partial differential equations and quantified uncertainty using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.

## Professional Experience

### Facebook Reality Labs, Redmond - Research Intern

Extended a block automatic differentiation framework to accelerate  nonlinear optimization problems on differentiable manifolds to calibrate sensors from observations. Implemented a modular simulation framework to enable uncertainty quantification and faster development of unit tests and benchmarks. 

### Goldman Sachs, NYC — Technology Analyst
Extended a Sybase IQ log parser to capture executed statements and associated metadata. Created Kibana dashboards to display IQ server diagnostics. Wrote an efficient bulk renderer to offload data onto an Elasticsearch instance.

### Teaching — Numerical Linear Algebra, Computer Vision, Operating Systems
Prepared student assignments including [coding a microkernel in C](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4410/2015fa/4411.php), [automated panorama stitching](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4670/2015sp/projects/pa3/), [convolutional networks](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4670/2015sp/projects/pa5/), randomized singular value decomposition methods and algebraic eigenvalue problems.

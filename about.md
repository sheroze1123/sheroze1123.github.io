I am a graduate student in Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin. I am working on large-scale inverse problems appearing in partial differential equations. I am exploring machine learning methods to characterize the uncertainty of a physical model.

I am interested in solving computational problems with an emphasis on mathematical analysis using robust software engineering principles.

## [Deep learning error models to accelerate high-dimensional Bayesian inference](https://github.com/sheroze1123/BayesianInferenceDL)
Ongoing work on improving reduced order models by better characterizing their error using deep learning methods. Improved reduced order models coupled with error models accelerate sampling-based Bayesian inference methods.

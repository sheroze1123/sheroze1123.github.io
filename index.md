I am a graduate student in Computational Science at the Oden Institute at  the University of Texas at Austin. I graduated from Cornell University with a B.Sc. in Computer Science. I am currently researching large-scale Bayesian inverse problems appearing in partial differential equations and deep learning models applied to physical systems.

I am interested in solving computational problems with an emphasis on mathematical analysis complemented by robust software engineering principles.
